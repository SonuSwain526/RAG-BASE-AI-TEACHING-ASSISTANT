So guys, we will continue the NLP playlist and in today's video we will see stemming vs lemmatization."},{"title":"Tutorial 3-What Is Tokenization And Its Implementation In Python_Krish Naik(1)","start":242.0,"end":9.0,"text":"Ok And in the nltk libraries This whole thing is mentioned Hello all, my name is Krishnayak and welcome to my YouTube channel.

So stemming is the process of reducing a word to its word stem that affixes to suffixes and prefixes or to the roots of the word known as lemma. Stemming is important in natural language understanding and even it is used in natural language processing. So in this much definition, you just have to remember that we will try to find out the base form of the words, their word stem. So if we want to know the definition of stemming, we have to find out the base form of the words, their word stem."},{"title":"Tutorial 4- Stemming And Lemmatization And Its Implementation NLP_Krish NAik(1)","start":55.0,"end":87.0,"text":"So we will see the differences between the two.
