    "text": " Hello all, my name is Krish Nayak and welcome to Krish Nayak Hindi YouTube channel. So guys, we are going to continue our NLP playlist series. I have already uploaded 3-4 videos on tokenization, lemmatization and all these things. But it was a bit late to upload the videos that were coming up because there are a lot of work to do. Apart from that, I have to upload videos on my main channel as well. So a lot of kids were requesting me to complete this playlist. So yes, I am following the strategy that I should at least complete this playlist for you all. We are going to read a lot of amazing things in this NLP playlist. After that, all these NLP playlists are going to be linked with the generative AI playlist. Because they will have a continuation. And according to me, NLP is a very important thing in today's time. Natural language processing, because if we talk about generative AI, LLM application, then amazing development is happening. Okay? So guys, we are going to continue this series. I will explain you about vectors with a complete basic scratch. I will explain you about text pre-processing, what are the techniques in it. Apart from that, how to do practical implementations, word to word, what is word embedding. There are going to be a lot of videos like this going forward. After that, we will connect this with deep learning NLP. Okay? So just try as much as you can to share my videos as much as possible. Because Hindi channel is very important for Hindi medium people. Because I have only uploaded Python, machine learning and stats playlist. I have only uploaded 4-5 videos of deep learning. After that, I have to continue. Now I want to focus on uploading as many videos as possible in Hindi playlist. All these things will be very beneficial for you guys. So please make sure that you keep liking, sharing and filling the comment section. With good comments. So let's start. I will share my screen. I will make sure that I keep my face hidden. Because I want to write with many examples here. So I don't want anything to be hidden from my face. I have received this feedback from my main channel specifically. So we are going to continue now. Now we are going to talk about text pre-processing. Now what is further in text pre-processing? Okay? See what things come in text pre-processing. Like your stemming, lemmatization, all these things. If I have my words, I have to lowercase them. So that is basically a text pre-processing. But most of the NLP use cases, if I talk about machine learning. So what happens? Let's understand one use case. Its name is sentiment analysis. Let's say we consider this use case. Now here is my data. Let's say this sentence 1 says that if the food is good, then output is equal to 1. Means this is a positive feedback. Okay? The food is bad. So here the output is 0. Means this is a negative feedback. And if I see in the third sentence, then it is written here, pizza is amazing. So here also you can see that this is 1. Means this is also a positive sentiment analysis. Means it is positive sentiment. Now this is my data. Now I will focus on this text data. This text data. Where I have written that the food is good. Now to say this food is good, as a we human being. If we want to understand this sentence, then this will be very easy. Right? Because the food is good, we are already trained. We know English language. So obviously we can easily say, okay bro, this food is good. Means the food is good. In this, he is telling you this. So obviously it means it will be a positive sentiment. Okay? But how will you be able to understand a machine? Sorry, how will you be able to understand an algorithm? Right? That is not possible. Because the algorithm, unless and until it is not trained in the data set. Right? Then the algorithm will not be able to understand it. Now the most important thing, do we know the algorithm?"
