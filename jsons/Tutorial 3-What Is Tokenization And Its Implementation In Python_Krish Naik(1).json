    "text": " Hello all my name is Krishna Aayak and welcome to my youtube channel So guys in today's video we are going to see third tutorial of NLP which we call tokenization Now we understand what is tokenization process In my previous video we saw basic terminology of NLP Which is called corpus, documents, vocabulary and words We call corpus as paragraph and documents as sentences Vocabulary as unique number of words in the dictionary and words as a specific word Now what is tokenization process? Always remember this and tokenization is very important At the end of the day we take any text data in NLP We will pre-process it and then we will convert it into vectors For pre-processing we need to use tokenization Now what is tokenization? Tokenization is a process where we will generate tokens We will generate tokens from the corpus Now what is tokenization? Let's say we have a paragraph If I want to convert this paragraph into a sentence Then I will use sentence tokenization So that we can generate a sentence from it If I have a paragraph or sentence If I want to display all the words in one place Then I will use words tokenizer Now what is sentence tokenizer and what is words tokenizer? These are all methods and I will call these sentences tokens in this paragraph So this is a process where we will use tokens In any sentence or paragraph we will try to generate tokens In this case we have token in sentences and word tokens Now let's see how we can use Python programming language Here I will use NLT library After that I will write a normal sentence How we can generate sentence or words from it Which we will call tokens So this is an entire process So let's go without wasting any time And let's understand Here is our entire code Now first thing is if you don't have a library Then please make sure you install pip pip install nltk You can install this library We will see later how to use specie and other things But for now we will use nltk Now I will take a simple sentence And let's say this is my corpus Corpus means paragraph And here I will write Hello welcome to Prash Nayak Hindi YouTube Prash Nayak's Hindi YouTube channel Ok And full stop And after that I will write here And after that if I go to a new line Then it also captures a new line Please do subscribe the channel Ok And here is my full stop And here is my simple sentence I have executed it Now if I This is my corpus Obviously I have a paragraph If I will do the first thing Where in I am converting a paragraph To a token which is called a sentence Ok Now if I want to extract a sentence from a paragraph So how can I do it? So what I will do is I will use import nltk And I can do one more thing That I can take tokenize from nltk Ok So what I will do is From nltk dot tokenize Ok And in the nltk libraries This whole thing is mentioned"
